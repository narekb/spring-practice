# Spring Practice
This repository houses my code snippets and projects developed for learning the Spring Framework.

Each distinct topic/project will be placed in a separate branch.
### Resources
I will keep adding other resources I found useful.
* [Craig Walls' Spring in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/spring-in-action-fifth-edition) (4th, 5th and 6th editions) - for learning theory and internals.
* [Spring Framework documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/)
### Topics
 * Bean wiring - Configuring dependency injection, explicit Java and XML configuration
 * Bean lifecycle - Using various methods of customising bean behavior during creation/disposal
